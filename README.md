Code Quiz

***Code Quiz:*** I was asked to create a code quiz that met the following criteria: 
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score

## Completed Steps:

* Created eight questions with each one having 4 possible answer choices
* Utilized EventListeners to create buttons linked to the 'click' function
* Utilized Math.random to shuffle the 8 questions
* Created functions that were linked to specific CSS data and reflected the user's choice (green for the correct answer, red for the wrong answer)
* Attempted tp integrate a timer into my JavaScript file that would start counting down from 60 seconds once the user slicked the 'Start' button
* Attempted to deduct 5 seconds from the timer with each question answered incorrectly
* Created README file with link & screenshot
